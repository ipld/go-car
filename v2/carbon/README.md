ðŸ’Ž Carbon
===

Carbon provides a [blockstore](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-blockstore) interface with saved blocks stored to a car-compatible log. A [Carbs](github.com/willscott/carbs/) index for the resulting file is tracked and can be saved as needed.

Note: Carbon does not support deletion.
